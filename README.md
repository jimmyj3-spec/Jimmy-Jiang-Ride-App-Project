A Java desktop application that simulates requesting and assigning rides. Users enter pickup and dropoff information, 
choose passenger details, and generate a ride request. The ride cost is based on the absolute difference between the two ZIP 
codes and only for valid input, such as integers, with an additional 10% express fee when the Express option is selected. After requesting a ride, the Assign Ride 
button opens a new window to assign a driver.
